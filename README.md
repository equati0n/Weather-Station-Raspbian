  ## About
Weather Station Application was designed to run on Raspberry Pi. The model used was 3b+. This application was also built with Qt Creator on a Raspberry Pi. An Arduino equipped with the DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, and a cadmium sulfide photoresistor feeds data into the program via USB. The AccuWeather API is being used to pull weather information from any chosen location.
